# BIDS Sensor Group

This repo is for the coordination of BIDS' sensor group. The goal is to develop a framework for the quick and cheap deployment of sensor networks, data delivery through RESTful APIs, and data aggregation for event detection and streams.

For now we will focus on environmental sensors.
