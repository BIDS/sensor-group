# Desired and potential applications

We did a lot of technology and skill development this semester? Why?

 - Potential behavior change interventions
 - Understanding software development
 - Fast / cheap development of novel sensor deployments

# Challenges / Learning

What did you struggle with? What did you learn?

At first I struggled with being very unfamiliar with a lot of computer science and hardware general knowledge, but because of this I learned more than I ever thought I could in one semester! I learned on a basic level how the internet works, how to use GitHub, how to make cool visualizations using d3, how to use arduinos, and how to work with API's. Although it was sometimes difficult not given so much direction and instruction, I realized that it was important to learn to explore the internet for available resources to try things on my own. 

## Software development

 - Learning about MongoDB database
 - Using d3.js 
 - Working with the GitHub API

## Hardware

 - Basic electronics
 - Arduino
 - etc.

# Next steps

Given our desired and potential applications, and our capabilities, what should
Glass Bead Labs tackle next?

 - Full-blown virtual reality simulation of Moorea
 - Distributed movement class interventions
 - etc.
