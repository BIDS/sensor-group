 - Fast / cheap development of novel sensor deployments

## Challenges / Learning

What did you struggle with? What did you learn?

### Software development
  
We started the semester by understanding web API's and how we can use these interfaces to collect and analyze data. Most of the learning curve of web API's came from authentication and understanding the provided API. Though the GitHub API was fairly easy to use, we ran into issues with authentication tokens and entering the right queries. We also learned how to use the web API of ASBase, an activity stream, to input data. After developing an issue tracker, we then modeled the API tracking software in a modular form so that future developers can easily use and add onto the project. This step taught us about good practices in software engineering and keeping our code usable. 

We also wrote software to aggregate data from our custom sensors. In this side of our project, we learned to write basic Arduino code and learned how to communicate data between a sensor and a database. We created an adapter, which implemented a protocol for standardized communication between the sensor and the database. We learned about serial communication and properly parsing and formatting data for a MongoDB database. 

On the data visualization side of the project, we learned about pulling data from a MongoDB database and using D3.js to visualize our data. After going through the basics of the framework, we all became acquainted with javascript and the challenges of data visualization - there are so many ways to model the same data! We also learned that there are more resources online than we thought, and it is always important to do some research online about existing resources before trying to reinvent the wheel. 

In bullet point format:
 - Pulling useful data and formatting data from Web API's
 - Pros/Cons of different API's
 - API authentication
 - Inserting data into databases
 - MongoDB language
 - D3.js
 - Arduino coding
 - Modular programming
 - Implementing protocols
 - Full-stack software engineering

### Hardware
Coming in with zero electronics experience, we learned the basics of electronics and circuits, as well as resources for easily creating cheap sensors. We learned about bluetooth communication, wiring and soldering circuits, and different types of sensors for environmental sensing. We primarily used Arduinos, and spent time learning about general Arduino hacking and interfacing with our sensors.

In bullet point format:
 - Arduino hacking
 - Basic electronics
 - Soldering
 - Building sensors
 - Bluetooth communication
 - Understanding sensor types and capabilities

### Next steps

Given our desired and potential applications, and our capabilities, what should
Glass Bead Labs tackle next?

 - Full-blown virtual reality simulation of Moorea
 - Distributed movement class interventions
