# Desired and potential applications

We did a lot of technology and skill development this semester? Why?

 - Potential behavior change interventions
 - Understanding software development
 - Fast / cheap development of novel sensor deployments

# Challenges / Learning

What did you struggle with? What did you learn?

In the beginning, I struggled with the lack of direction and instruction we received, but I later realized that this was part of the research process!  I eventually got into the flow of the program and really learned a lot of different aspects in the pipeline just by trial and error, such as working with the actual sensors to properly visualizing them.  What I really took away from this research apprenticeship was learning how to take an idea and bring it into existance.

## Software development

 - Learning about and using MongoDB database
 - Different javascript libraries
  - Express
  - d3
  - epoch
  - Node
 - Working with multiple APIs
  - Slack
  - Github
  

## Hardware

 - Basic electronics
 - Arduino

# Next steps

Given our desired and potential applications, and our capabilities, what should
Glass Bead Labs tackle next?

 - Full-blown virtual reality simulation of Moorea
 - Distributed movement class interventions
 - Something with wearables
 - etc.
